## Bugs

- Disable userInteraction on the centerController if not zoomed
- Fix the heights of the navControllers on each sideMenu

## Roadmap


- Seeking still takes a while, find a way to buffer the next song beforehand
- Native soundcloud integration, play within the app (or download!) instead of redirecting to soundcloud
- Prevent duplicate songs from showing and saving
- Parse buffer data to make a pulse graphical display
- Change the saved songs view to have dynamic cell height
- Enable individual deletion of saved songs
- Add an option to listen to the preview or the whole song
- Refactor the code to make it less hacky
